# Documentation
The documentation is written to let people know about our project and to inform them that we are new to open-source projects so it's not as comprehensive as it could be.
We will be providing all the instructions and information regarding how to use the Hospital Management System, which is going to be used by the patients, doctors and other staff members of the hospital.
A hospital management system is a software program  thataids medical facilities in automating their financial,clinical and administrative processes.
 This system's automation of processes like patient registration,booking appointments, medical record management and billing can increase productivity, enhance patient care, and lower expenses.
In addition, we intend to omit some of our work from this documentation, even though it will still give an overview of our work and a recommendation for the expert's accomplishments and what would be appropriate
